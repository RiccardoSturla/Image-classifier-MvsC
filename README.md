# Image-classifier-MvsC
This repository contains the project for the course "Statistical method for Machine Learning".

The project aims to experiment with different Convolutional Neural Network architectures to find the best model to correctly classify images of muffins and chihuahuas. The CNNs are created on Google Colab using Keras.
